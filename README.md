## üìã **What is the IRA Calculator?**

The IRA Calculator is a comprehensive workforce planning tool designed specifically for construction and energy projects that must comply with the **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) apprenticeship requirements**. This web-based application helps project managers, contractors, and workforce planners ensure their projects meet the 15% minimum apprentice hour requirement for tax credit eligibility.

## üéØ **Key Business Benefits**

- **IRA Compliance**: Automatically calculates and tracks apprentice percentages to ensure tax credit eligibility
- **Workforce Planning**: Visualize workforce requirements across multiple trades and time periods
- **Cost Optimization**: Plan efficient ramp-up and ramp-down schedules to minimize labor costs
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify compliance gaps before they impact project timelines or tax benefits
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Generate professional reports and visualizations for project presentations

## üèóÔ∏è **How It Works**

### **1. Project Setup**
- Define your project timeline and scope
- Add multiple trades (Electrical, Mechanical, Civil)
- Specify project capacity in megawatts (MW)

### **2. Workforce Configuration**
- Set man-hours required per megawatt for each trade
- Configure ramp-up and ramp-down periods
- Define apprentice ratios (Civil trade automatically set to 0% per IRA rules)

### **3. Real-Time Analysis**
- View individual trade workforce curves
- See combined project timeline with overlapping trades
- Monitor apprentice percentage compliance in real-time
- Generate comprehensive project overviews
