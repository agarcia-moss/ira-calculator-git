## 🚀 Git Commands to Push Changes

```bash
# First, install the updated dependencies
npm install

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix Electron build issues and add GitHub Actions for automated releases

- Update Electron to stable v28.1.0 and fix compatibility issues
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Create multi-platform GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds
- Add electron-builder.yml with proper platform configurations
- Include documentation for testing and release process
- Fix cross-platform build scripts with cross-env"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main

# After pushing, create your first release tag
git tag v1.0.1 -m "First stable release with automated builds"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Verify Push**: Check that all files are pushed to GitHub
2. **Monitor Actions**: Go to the Actions tab to see workflows running
3. **First Release**: The v1.0.1 tag will trigger your first automated release
4. **Edit Release Notes**: Once draft is created, edit and publish
5. **Test Installation**: Download and test artifacts from the release

## 🔧 Quick Reference

### Local Testing Commands:
```bash
npm run electron          # Development mode
npm run dist:win         # Build for Windows
npm run dist:mac         # Build for macOS  
npm run dist:linux       # Build for Linux
```

### Creating New Releases:
```bash
# Update version in package.json first
npm version patch        # For bug fixes (1.0.1 -> 1.0.2)
npm version minor        # For new features (1.0.2 -> 1.1.0)
npm version major        # For breaking changes (1.1.0 -> 2.0.0)

# Push with tags
git push && git push --tags
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **First Build**: The first GitHub Actions build may take longer as it caches dependencies
2. **Secrets**: No additional secrets needed - uses default GITHUB_TOKEN
3. **Code Signing**: Currently builds unsigned. Add certificates later for production
4. **Auto-Updates**: Will work once you have published releases

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Refer to the TESTING_GUIDE.md for troubleshooting steps
3. Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
4. Ensure your GitHub repository settings allow Actions

Good luck with your releases! 🎉
