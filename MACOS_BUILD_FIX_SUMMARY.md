# macOS-Only Build Configuration Summary

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed macOS Universal Binary Build
- ✅ Updated `npm run dist:mac` to explicitly build both `--x64` and `--arm64`
- ✅ Modified electron-builder.yml to properly configure both architectures
- ✅ Created `build-mac.sh` script for easy building with verification

### 2. Removed Windows and Linux Support
- ✅ Removed Windows and Linux build configurations from package.json
- ✅ Removed Windows and Linux sections from electron-builder.yml
- ✅ Updated GitHub Actions to only build for macOS
- ✅ Simplified release workflow for single platform

### 3. Updated Documentation
- ✅ Release template now focuses on macOS installation instructions
- ✅ Testing guide updated for macOS-only workflow
- ✅ Added clear instructions for Intel vs Apple Silicon

## 🛠️ How to Build Locally

### Option 1: Using npm script
```bash
npm run dist:mac
```
This runs both builds sequentially.

### Option 2: Using build script (recommended)
```bash
./build-mac.sh
```

### Option 3: Build specific architecture
```bash
npm run dist:mac:x64   # Builds both but you can ignore arm64
npm run dist:mac:arm64 # Builds both but you can ignore x64
```

**Note**: Due to electron-builder behavior, it creates both architectures regardless of the command, but the files are properly named:
- `IRA Calculator-{version}-x64.dmg` - For Intel Macs
- `IRA Calculator-{version}-arm64.dmg` - For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)

## 🚀 GitHub Actions

The release workflow now:
1. Only runs on `macos-latest`
2. Builds both Intel and Apple Silicon versions
3. Uploads both DMG files to the GitHub release
4. Includes the auto-update configuration file

## 📝 Key File Changes

### Modified Files:
- `package.json` - Removed Windows/Linux scripts and configs
- `electron-builder.yml` - macOS-only configuration
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Single platform workflow
- `.github/workflows/test-build.yml` - macOS-only testing
- `.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md` - macOS installation instructions
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - macOS-specific testing steps

### New Files:
- `build-mac.sh` - Convenient build script with verification

## ✅ Verification

To verify both architectures are built:

1. Run the build:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/
   npm run dist:mac
   ```

2. Check the output:
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/*.dmg
   ```

3. You should see both files:
   ```
   -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  140M  date  dist/IRA Calculator-1.0.0-arm64.dmg
   -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  146M  date  dist/IRA Calculator-1.0.0-x64.dmg
   ```

The build script (./build-mac.sh) will also verify this automatically.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If only one architecture builds:
1. Make sure you're using the updated scripts
2. Clear the dist folder: `rm -rf dist/`
3. Try using the explicit command: `npx electron-builder --mac --x64 --arm64`
4. Check electron-builder version is 24.9.1

## 📦 Distribution

Your coworkers can now:
1. Go to the Releases page
2. Download the appropriate DMG for their Mac type
3. Install by dragging to Applications
4. The app will auto-update when new releases are available

## 🔄 Auto-Update Fix (Latest)

Fixed the "Loading..." version display and update check failures:
- ✅ Added IPC handlers for `get-app-version` and `check-for-updates`
- ✅ Fixed update message channel from 'message' to 'update-message'
- ✅ Improved error messages for better user experience
- ✅ Version now displays correctly in settings
- ✅ Update checks work (will show "no releases" until first GitHub release)
