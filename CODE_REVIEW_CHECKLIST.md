## üîç Common Build Issues to Check

### Before Building
1. **Clean previous builds**
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/ build/
   ```

2. **Fresh dependency install**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Check Node.js version**
   - Should be v16+ (v18 recommended)

4. **Verify all assets exist**
   - `public/transparent_moss.png` (app icon)
   - `public/electron.js` (main process)
   - `public/preload.js` (preload script)

### Platform-Specific Issues

- [ ] Visual Studio Build Tools installed (for native modules)
- [ ] No path length issues (keep project path short)
- [ ] Antivirus not blocking electron-builder

#### macOS
- [ ] Xcode Command Line Tools installed
- [ ] No code signing errors (can build unsigned for testing)
- [ ] Permissions for app to access required resources

#### Linux
- [ ] Required system libraries installed
- [ ] Proper permissions on build scripts
- [ ] Desktop integration configured

## üìã Final Pre-Release Checklist

1. **Version Management**
   - [ ] Version bumped in package.json
   - [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
   - [ ] No debug code left in production

2. **Testing**

   - [ ] Auto-updater tested (if possible)
   - [ ] No console errors in production

3. **Security**

   - [ ] Startup time acceptable

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] README updated with installation instructions
   - [ ] Release notes prepared
   - [ ] Known issues documented

## üöÄ Release Process

1. Commit all changes
2. Create and push version tag: `git tag v1.0.1 && git push origin v1.0.1`
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and create draft release
4. Edit release notes and publish when ready
5. Verify auto-updater works for existing installations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure no conflicting global packages
- Try building locally first

### Release Not Created
- Verify GitHub token has proper permissions
- Check tag format matches `v*` pattern
- Ensure workflow file syntax is correct

### Auto-Update Not Working
- Check app-update.yml configuration
- Verify GitHub releases are public
- Check electron-updater logs
- Ensure version numbers are incrementing properly
